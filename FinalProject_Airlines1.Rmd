```{r include=FALSE}
require(knitr)
require(markdown)
airlines = read.csv(".//data//airlines.csv")
airlines = airlines[is.na(airlines$arr_flights) ==0,]
colnames(airlines)[10]="weather_ct"
colnames(airlines)[16]="arr_delay"
colnames(airlines)[17]="carrier_delay"
colnames(airlines)[2]="month"

```

In this project, I used dataset from Bureau of Transportation Statistics to analyze performance of different US Domestic Air Carrier in the period of 2003-2015. 

Since June 2003, the airlines that report on-time data also report the causes of delays and cancellations to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and we used this dataset to compare delay for top 6 largest air carrier in USA.

Structure of Data:
```{r echo=FALSE}
str(airlines)


```


Summary of data:
```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(airlines)

```

##Initial Analysis: EDA
Below chart shows my initial run to display the performance of US domestic flights in terms of their carrier delay. As you see, x shows the years and y shows average carrier delay based on minutes. Each line in the diagram shows the performance of a carrier.

This is such a busy figure and obviously it is not efficient in delivering analysis. For the next step, I will pick only 6 airlines based on the number of arrival flights. For the rest of this project I will only analyze and visualize data related to top largest air carrier at US.

```{r echo=FALSE}
top6 = tail(sort(tapply(airlines$arr_flights, airlines$carrier_name, sum)))
top6.carrier_name = labels(top6)
top6.carrier_name = top6.carrier_name[[1]]
top6_airlines = airlines[airlines$carrier_name %in% top6.carrier_name  ,]
top6_airlines$X = NULL
top6_airlines$carrier_name = factor(top6_airlines$carrier_name)



```

## Final Visualizations
Now, we have all the performance information for following air carriers which are in fact the top largerst US domestic air carriers:

```{r echo=FALSE}
levels(top6_airlines$carrier_name)

```

In this project the objective is to:

* Comparing the performance of Delta Air Lines Inc. with Other Carriers

In fact, during last five years **Delta Air Lines Inc.** has outperformed other US domestic carriers as it has less delay. More specifically:

* Delta Air Lines is now one of the best US carriers in terms of flight delay percentage
* It had less overal and carrier delay comparing to other airlines

To show the performance of carriers, I will aggregate data by *year* and *carrier name* and then I will add new features that are required to do above analysis.

To display the delay metrics over time, I will use combination of point (scatter plot) and line chart. Using point, I can precisly display the measure and audience can easily compare. Also, I will add lines to be able to show trends of the performance over year. This makes it easy to see how perfomance of each carrier changed over time. 


```{r include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
aggregated_data = aggregate(top6_airlines[,7:ncol(top6_airlines)], by = list(top6_airlines$year,top6_airlines$carrier_name), FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)

colnames(aggregated_data)[1] = "year"
colnames(aggregated_data)[2] = "carrier_name"

aggregated_data$avg_arr_del15 = 100 * aggregated_data$arr_del15/aggregated_data$arr_flights
aggregated_data$avg_carrier_ct = 100 * aggregated_data$carrier_ct/aggregated_data$arr_flights
aggregated_data$avg_arr_cancelled = 100 * aggregated_data$arr_cancelled/aggregated_data$arr_flights
aggregated_data$avg_arr_delay = aggregated_data$arr_delay/aggregated_data$arr_flights
aggregated_data$avg_carrier_delay = aggregated_data$carrier_delay/aggregated_data$arr_flights
aggregated_data$avg_ontime = 100 - aggregated_data$avg_arr_del15

write.csv(aggregated_data, ".//data//summary_airlines.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

### Average Delay

Following figure shows how the average delay changed over time for each of the carriers.

![Caption for the picture.](https://github.com/dev509/data-visualization/blob/master/img/Top6_DelayMin.JPG)

As you can see the average delay per flight fluctuated between 5 and 17 mins. Over the last 4 years Delta Air Lines had the lowest delay comparing to other carriers.

### Percentage of Late Flights

Following figure shows percentage of late flights for each of the carrier. A flight is marked as late when it reaches its destination with delay of more than 15 minutes.

![Caption for the picture.](https://github.com/dev509/data-visualization/blob/master/img/Top6_DelayedPer.JPG)

Based on the diagram, the percentage for late flight is in range of 10 to 30%. As we can see in the line chart, Delta Airlines is doing very well comparing to other carriers in this department, especially for the last five years the percentage of its late flights is significantly lower than other carriers'.

### Percentage of On-Time Flights

Follwing figure is very similar to the previous figure. This one displays the on-time flights while the last one was showing the late flights.

### Average Delay due to Carrier

Delay in flights can come from different sources, such as carrier, security check, weather and etc. In following two figures we focus on only those delays which are due to carrier.

Following figure displays the average delay due to carrier per flight.  

![Caption for the picture.](https://github.com/dev509/data-visualization/blob/master/img/Top6_CarrierDelayMin.JPG)

As you can see, ExpressJet have had the highest delay for the last five years, while Southwest Airlines, Delta and Skywest Airlines were among the lowest in this category.

### Percentage of Late Flight due to Carrier

Following figure shows the percentage of flights that are late dure to carrier. 

![Caption for the picture.](https://github.com/dev509/data-visualization/blob/master/img/Top6_DelayedCarrierPerc.JPG)

As you can see Skywest was one of the worst between 2003-2008 but they managed to be one of the best for last 8 years. Also Delta Airlines is among the best for this category.



## Feedback
I had shown the chart and the diagrams to four of my friends and here are some ideas that I got from them and applied to improvise my charts:


1- The Dependent value was vague and it was difficult to understand the measure or unit of the variable

First I used proportion of on-time or late flights, instead of percentage. So the number for late flights were like .02 or .11 which were not as readable as percentage. I changed it to percentage.


2- Legends were distracting

The legend was on the side and it took some spaces that I could use to enlarge my graph. So I used the empty space in the chart to put the legend




3- Based on data for On-Time flight rates chart, there was significant difference between carriers, however, the way I had scaled the y axis didn't really deliever the point!

The range for percentage of on-time flight is between 70 and 90%. The diagram initially had y axis from (0 to 100%) which made a lot of empty space in the chart and also the difference of perfromance among the carriers were not really visible. I shortened the range from (0,100) to (60,90) so the difference would more obvious to eyes of the readers!

4- The code was not scalable and it seemed to be redundant

The code was not really readable and scalable. I made it more modular so it will be easier to scale!

5- Colors were  not consistent and it made it difficult to follow performance in different charts

In each chart the line for each carrier was different so it made it a little bit difficult for the reader to follow a story. I fixed the color for each carrier for all of the charts.

6- There was not a story behind the graphs. It was more Explporatory than Explanatory

In the new version, I focused on Delta Air Lines and how it performs comparing to other carriers. I believe Delta Air Lines is currently one of the best US Domestic Air Lines in terms of delay.
